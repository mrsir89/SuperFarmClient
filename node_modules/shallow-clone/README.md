> Creates a shallow clone of any JavaScript value.

Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save shallow-clone
```

## Usage

```js
const clone = require('shallow-clone');
```

**Supports**

* array buffers
* arrays
* buffers
* dates
* errors
* float32 arrays
* float64 arrays
* int16 arrays
* int32 arrays
* int8 arrays
* maps
* objects
* primitives
* regular expressions
* sets
* symbols
* uint16 arrays
* uint32 arrays
* uint8 arrays
* uint8clamped arrays

## Arrays

By default, only the array itself is cloned (shallow), use [clone-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep) if you also need the elements in the array to be cloned.

```js
const arr = [{ a: 0 }, { b: 1 }];
const foo = clone(arr);
// foo =>  [{ 'a': 0 }, { 'b': 1 }]

// array is cloned
assert(actual === expected); // false

// array elements are not
assert.deepEqual(actual[0], expected[0]); // true
```

## Objects

Only the object is shallow cloned, use [clone-deep](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/clone-deep) if you also need the values in the object to be cloned.

```js
console.log(clone({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }));
//=> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
```

## RegExp

Clones regular expressions and flags, and preserves the `.lastIndex`.

```js
const regex = clone(/foo/g); //=> /foo/g
// you can manually reset lastIndex if necessary
regex.lastIndex = 0;
```

## Primitives

Simply returns primitives unchanged.

```js
clone(0); //=> 0
clone('foo'); //=> 'foo'
```
